# stocks
Try to work with some stock market APIs, later hopes to analyze and GUIfy.

I don't have a unified structure or clear plan for the thing, but here's some hints on what to expect:
* Impetus
  * In recent months, I have started a Robinhood account, and have started having lots of fun trading and exploring common stock trading.
* What's Around
  * I have discovered the Finnhub API, as well as some python Gists with which to access it.
    * Looks like this will be useful for OHLC data, quote data, etc.
    * Seems like it's simple enough for even _me_ to handle building my own REST calls from any code (Goodbye Python, hello Kotlin)
  * I have discovered a python repo on here (TODO: cite it) that can actually download my order history into a CSV file, or store many other Robinhood API calls into JSON output files.
* What I'm thinking
  * TODO (?)
